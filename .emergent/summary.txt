The AI engineer successfully built an MVP sports mobile application, progressing from a basic match listing and rating system to a sophisticated platform with user authentication, fan voting, push notifications, and an Admin Debug panel. Initial work focused on a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and an Expo frontend, evolving to include a strict 24-hour voting window. Subsequent development centered on implementing a structured competitions system (Leagues, Cups), integrating lineups and injuries into match details, and robust backend endpoints with timezone handling and admin protection. Most recently, the work shifted towards agent-only hosting via a Render Blueprint and a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul. The AI has prepared the codebase for deployment and implemented significant frontend UI changes, including a new card design system, typography, header profile, and demo mode. The current state reflects an active implementation of these extensive UI adjustments, with several file modifications still underway.

<product_requirements>
The MVP mobile application is a full-stack Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB solution for sports fans. It features:
1.  **Match Listing**: Home screen displays matches grouped by date, with time, teams (flags/colors), tournament, subgroup, and TV channels (user's default country, e.g., Switzerland).
2.  **Match Details**: Comprehensive match info, multi-country channel selector, fan voting (like/dislike, MVP, scorer, etc., with results as percentages), and push notification reminders. A strict 24-hour voting window, starting post-match, is enforced.
3.  **My Teams**: Lists favorite teams and their upcoming matches.
4.  **Settings**: Configures default country, theme (Light/Dark), reminders (7d/1d/1h), Display clubs like national teams, Reduce effects, and 12h vote reminder. An Admin Debug panel (dev-only) for notification management, device diagnostics, backend URL, device timezone, and a Force Demo Mode switch.
5.  **User System**: Email/password registration/login, JWT authentication, user scoring based on vote alignment, and a leaderboard displaying top 20 users. All voting/rating requires authentication.
6.  **Competitions**: Support for Championships (Leagues) and Cups with id, name, country, season, type, start/end dates. Matches are linked to competitions, displayed with local time.
7.  **Lineups & Injuries**: Match details extended with formations, starters, bench players, and unavailable players (injuries, suspensions). Admin-only manual editing.
8.  **UI/UX**: Modern iOS-inspired glassmorphism design with light/dark themes, strict global card layout (margin, padding, borderRadius), detailed glass styles (background, border, shadow, blur intensity), fixed card heights, and a defined typography scale. Profile removed from bottom tabs, replaced by top-right avatar opening a modal with Profile, Settings, Logout.
9.  **Hosting**: One-click Render Blueprint for FastAPI backend and Expo Web static site, with MongoDB Atlas. Includes health/version endpoints, seeded demo data (6-8 matches, demo user demo@demo.com / Demo123!), and robust import handling.

<code_architecture>
The project uses a standard full-stack structure with  (Expo) and  (FastAPI).



-   : Core FastAPI backend. Contains all API endpoints for matches, users, authentication, ratings, fan voting, push notifications, and the strict 24h voting window logic. Recently extended for competitions, lineups/injuries (models, CRUD, seeding), health/version endpoints, and graceful TheSportsDB import handling.
-   : (NEW) Render Blueprint configuration file for one-click deployment of backend and static frontend.
-   : (NEW) Example environment variables for the backend, including new , , , .
-   : Redirects to the main tabs, likely  (previously main match list, now likely redirected or replaced by  or  as the main tab).
-   : Defines the tab-based navigation. Modified to add the Competitions tab and to potentially remove Profile (now accessed via header avatar).
-   : (NEW) Displays a list of all available competitions. Implemented with skeleton loaders, pull-to-refresh, error handling, and navigation to competition details.
-   : (NEW) Displays details for a specific competition, including a list of its matches grouped by date, showing local times. Handles  parameter.
-   : Match Details screen. Enhanced with new Lineups and Unavailable cards, Try again buttons, Share button stub, admin JSON editor (dev-only), and improved error handling.
-    & : User authentication screens.
-   : Settings screen. Expanded to include Admin diagnostics card (backend URL, device timezone, Force Demo Mode switch).
-   : (MOVED/RENAMED) Profile screen, now likely part of a modal accessed from the header avatar.
-   : Leaderboard screen.
-   : (NEW - stub) Placeholder route for future Team News feature.
-   : (MOVED/RENAMED from ) Centralized API client. Updated to include timezone parameter for requests,  helper, and demo mode fallbacks.
-   : Defines UI theme, including colors, typography, and now the detailed global card styling (glassmorphism properties for light/dark, border radius, padding, etc.).
-   : Zustand store for authentication state.
-   : Zustand store for UI state, now including  and .
-    & : (NEW) Zustand store and data for local demo content, used when Demo Mode is active or network fails.
-   : (NEW) Deployment guide for the one-click Render blueprint.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Provide 3 screenshots (Matches list, Competition list, Match Details) in both light and dark themes, showcasing the new UI.
-   Proceed with the one-click Render deploy.
-   Run automated smoke checks (backend + frontend) as specified.
-   Share Public Backend URL, Expo Web URL, and smoke test results.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul, strictly adhering to a new set of design tokens and layout rules provided by the user. This involves adjusting global card styling (e.g., , specific  and  for light/dark themes,  intensities for iOS, shadow/elevation for Android), fixed heights for competition (140) and match cards (172), and defining a precise typography scale (TitleXL, TitleM, BodyM, BodyR, CaptionM, CaptionR).

Key changes being applied include:
-   **Global Card Styling**: Updating existing and new cards (Matches list, Competitions list, all Match Details sections like Header, Lineups, Unavailable, Channels, Rate, Cast your vote, Player ratings, Fan voting) to use the new tokens.
-   **Header Profile Entry**: Removing Profile from the bottom tabs and replacing it with a top-right avatar (circle 28, hitbox 44) on main tabs. Tapping this avatar will open a modal containing Profile details (email, score), Settings, and Logout options.
-   **Share & Long-press**: Keeping the Share button (top-right on Match card/details) with a Copy Link fallback. The long-press sheet on match rows will continue to offer Share, Add to Calendar, and Copy Link actions.
-   **File Edits**: Recent activity (Chat 176-186) shows file modifications in  (for new UI tokens), ,  (for tabs structure, likely removing Profile), , , , , , and . These edits are directly related to applying the new UI styles and updating navigation as requested. The last message confirms an edit to  was successful, indicating the UI implementation is still actively being applied.

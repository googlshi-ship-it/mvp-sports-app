The AI engineer successfully built an MVP sports mobile application, moving from a basic concept to a feature-rich platform. Initial work focused on a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and an Expo frontend, establishing core functionalities like match listings, fan voting with a 24-hour window, and user authentication. Subsequent development introduced structured competitions, lineup/injury details, and robust backend endpoints with timezone handling. A major UI/UX overhaul was implemented, adhering to a strict glassmorphism design system, including global card styling, typography, and a new header profile navigation. Most recently, the engineer integrated a Rivalry feature (backend model, admin API, UI accents), a cross-platform Share action, updated Expo package dependencies to resolve warnings, and prepared the project for one-click Render deployment and Expo publish. Persistent challenges with automated UI screenshot capture in the dev environment were noted, leading to the use of design-faithful mock screenshots. The project is now ready for deployment and final visual verification.

<product_requirements>
The MVP mobile application is a full-stack Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB solution for sports enthusiasts, covering:
1.  **Match Display & Interaction**: View matches grouped by date, access detailed match information, select multi-country TV channels, participate in fan voting (like/dislike, MVP, scorer) with a strict 24-hour window, and set push notification reminders.
2.  **User System**: User registration/login (email/password), JWT authentication, user scoring based on vote alignment, and a leaderboard of top 20 users. All voting requires authentication.
3.  **Content Structure**: Support for Competitions (Leagues, Cups) with details like name, country, season. Match details include formations, starters, bench, and unavailable players (injuries/suspensions), editable by admin. Users can list favorite teams.
4.  **Personalization & Admin**: Settings for default country, theme (Light/Dark), reminder cadences, Display clubs like national teams, Reduce effects, 12h vote reminder. An Admin Debug panel provides tools like notification management and Force Demo Mode.
5.  **UI/UX**: Modern iOS-inspired glassmorphism design, light/dark themes, strict global card layout (margins, padding, border radius, glass styles, fixed heights), and defined typography. Profile access shifted from bottom tabs to a top-right avatar modal.
6.  **Deployment**: One-click Render Blueprint for FastAPI backend and Expo Web static site, utilizing MongoDB Atlas, including health/version endpoints and seeded demo data.
7.  **New Features**: Implementation of a Rivalry feature for matches (backend model, admin endpoint, UI chip/glow/accessibility label) and a cross-platform Share action for match details.

<pending_tasks>
-   Publish the Expo frontend to Expo.dev using the user's account and credentials.
-   Re-capture 6 screenshots (Matches list, Competitions list, Match Details in light/dark themes) from the *deployed* (Render static site or Expo Go) UI to accurately reflect the implemented rivalry accents.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed the final integration of the Rivalry feature's UI accents and resolved most outstanding Expo package version warnings.

Specifically:
-   **Rivalry UI Accents**:
    -   In  (Matches list cards), a  chip (displaying Derby or ) and a subtle top-edge red-orange glow () have been implemented for rivalry matches. These visual elements are integrated within the  structure, maintaining all locked card metrics (margin, padding, border radius, fixed height of 172). An  has also been added to the card's .
    -   Similarly, in  (Match Details header), the same  chip is now displayed next to the tournament name, and the subtle top-edge glow is present in the main header card area for rivalry matches. All big-card design tokens and sizes were strictly preserved.
    -   Both implementations are controlled by the  feature flag, which is exported from  and defaults to .
-   **Expo Warning Cleanup**: The  file has been updated, bumping  to  and  to  (along with  and pinning ). This addressed the majority of version warnings in the development logs.
-   **Share Action Verification**: The cross-platform Share functionality, previously implemented in  and  (native , web  with  fallback and Link copied to clipboard toast), has been verified and remains functional.
-   **Expo Publish Preparation**: The  configuration is ready for an Expo publish, but the actual publishing step requires user  and  commands due to authentication requirements.
-   **Screenshots**: Six mock screenshots, representing the UI with the implemented rivalry accents in both light and dark themes, are saved under . Due to persistent dev server instability, real-time UI captures were not feasible in the current environment.
-   **Backend & Docs**: Backend rivalry endpoints (model, seeds, admin POST) were tested and passed, and  and  are up-to-date.

The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's persistent efforts to enable Android APK builds for an Expo application via GitHub Actions. Initially, the focus was on local Gradle and Expo EAS build configurations, resolving numerous conflicts related to SDK versions (React/React Native/Expo), Hermes, and the New Architecture, often complicated by platform mismatches and user frustration with basic GitHub UI operations like file creation and deletion.

When local builds proved challenging, the strategy shifted to a GitHub Actions workflow. The AI iteratively guided the user through creating and refining the  workflow, , , and  files. Multiple attempts were made using mock APKs, local /Gradle commands, and eventually Expo Application Services (EAS) builds. Recurring issues included dependency conflicts, missing asset files, and problems with EAS project initialization and keystore generation in a non-interactive environment. The AI consistently adapted its approach, simplifying configurations and troubleshooting based on user-provided error logs and links. The conversation highlights the iterative, often frustrating nature of mobile CI/CD debugging, especially when relying on manual user actions for file updates.

The MVP mobile application is a full-stack Expo/FastAPI/MongoDB solution designed for sports enthusiasts. Its core functionality includes displaying football matches grouped by date, offering detailed match information with multi-country TV channels, and enabling fan voting (visible post-match). User authentication (email/password, JWT) is central for features like scoring and a leaderboard. Content is organized around Competitions (Leagues, Cups) and match details, drawing live data from Football-Data.org. Personalization features include saving/sorting preferred competitions, country selection, theme (Light/Dark), reminders, and display preferences. The UI/UX follows a modern iOS-inspired glassmorphism design, adhering to strict layout rules, safe area handling, dark theme consistency, and a two-tab navigation structure for Competitions and Matches. Profile/Settings are accessible via a top-right avatar. The application is intended for deployment via Render Blueprint and Expo.dev publishing (EAS Update). Future enhancements include a Rivalry system and cross-platform Share actions. The current implementation is a minimal Expo Router frontend with basic navigation, and the user's primary goal is to achieve a *real*, runnable Android APK for daily development and eventual release to Play Market and Apple App Store.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in the process of guiding the user to manually set up and debug the GitHub Actions workflow for building a *real* Android APK for the MVP Sports App. The user was experiencing persistent build failures, reporting ошибка опять! (error again!) multiple times after applying the AI's instructions.

The latest series of interactions focused on using EAS for the build. The user had successfully added the  to GitHub Secrets and the AI had provided instructions to create  and update  for an EAS build. However, after the user applied these changes and ran the workflow (Chat 167), an error occurred, logs revealed: . This indicated that EAS was attempting to create a keystore for signing the APK, which wasn't supported in non-interactive mode or was missing necessary configuration.

The AI's most recent action (Chat 171) was to provide a corrected  content, explicitly removing the  property. The goal of this change is to allow EAS to handle the credentials process itself, thereby bypassing the error related to the missing . The AI has provided the specific code snippet for the user to copy-paste into their  file.
